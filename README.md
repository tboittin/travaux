## What is Hacker News ?
Hacker News seems to be a forum where tech news are gathered with the objective to keep quality of information and contribution.

Hacker News Homepage is a table where each entry is a new. Every new has been posted by a user, has a amount of point and has some comment about it.

The feed is available through the hackernews API located here: https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0.
